# Mobile-Banking
The code represents a mobile banking system with different payment methods such as Nagad, Bkash, and Rocket. Each payment method is implemented as a separate class that extends the Account class. The Account class defines common functionalities like adding money, cashing out, and updating PIN numbers. The Nagad, Bkash, and Rocket classes provide specific implementations for each payment method, including limits on adding money, cash out restrictions, and PIN updates. The Bank class demonstrates the usage of these payment methods by creating instances and performing various banking operations such as adding money, cashing out, and updating PIN numbers.
